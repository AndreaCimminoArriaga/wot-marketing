# Blog Posts
Posts should be short and concise - our first iterations are usually (much too) verbose. At the time of social media and microblogging, the shorter, the better. If you have at least one illustration, that boosts significantly the reach of a piece.

You can see examples of W3C posts at:

The aim of blog posts are to draw attention to the aims and progress of the WoT IG and WG.
Ideally, the blog post would support our credibility (i.e, whoâ€™s driving it), 
and the rational and emotional arguments for the Web of Things.
