# Blog Posts
Posts should be short and concise - our first iterations are usually much too verbose.
At the time of social media and microblogging, the shorter, the better.
If you have at least one illustration, that boosts significantly the reach of a piece.
Include links for followup.
Finally, be aware that some readers will not be native English speakers and so
use short sentences and avoid complicated grammar or unusual vocabulary.

You can see examples of W3C posts at
[https://www.w3.org/blog/](https://www.w3.org/blog/).

The aim of blog posts are to draw attention to the aims and progress of the WoT IG and WG.
Ideally, the blog post would support our credibility (i.e, whoâ€™s driving it),
and the rational and emotional arguments for the Web of Things.

Blogs for WoT should be first proposed in a PR against the [draft](draft) directory for review,
then after merging the version in the draft directory can be editorially cleaned up prior
to publication (editorial changes should be limited to "minor" changes, such as adding links
or images, or fixing clear mistakes such as spelling problems).
See also the
[publication policy](https://www.w3.org/WoT/IG/wiki/Marketing_WebConf#Policies_and_Publication_Procedures).
After they are published, the final version of blogs should be
moved to the [published](published) directory for archival.

Filenames should use
the format `yyyy-mm-title.md` (update the date when moving to the published folder
if the review was started in a different month than the publication).  This format
allows listings to be automatically sorted by date.  If subdirectories are needed
for images, use the same format but without the suffix.  HTML is also acceptable,
especially for the final version.
