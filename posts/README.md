# Blog Posts
Posts should be short and concise - our first iterations are usually (much too) verbose.
At the time of social media and microblogging, the shorter, the better.
If you have at least one illustration, that boosts significantly the reach of a piece.
Include links for followup.

You can see examples of W3C posts at:

The aim of blog posts are to draw attention to the aims and progress of the WoT IG and WG.
Ideally, the blog post would support our credibility (i.e, whoâ€™s driving it), 
and the rational and emotional arguments for the Web of Things.

Blogs for WoT should be first placed in the [draft](draft) directory for review,
then after following the 
[publication policy](https://www.w3.org/WoT/IG/wiki/Marketing_WebConf#Policies_and_Publication_Procedures) 
and published, the final version should be 
moved to the [published](published) directory for archival.  Filenames should use
the format `yyyy-mm-title.md` (update the date when moving to the published folder
if the review was started in a different month than the publication).  This format
allows listings to be automatically sorted by date.  If subdirectories are needed
for images, use the same format but without the suffix.  HTML is also acceptable,
especially for the final version.
