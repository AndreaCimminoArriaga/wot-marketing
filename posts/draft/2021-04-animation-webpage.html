The Web of Things standardization activities are now illustrated through a new animation!
This animation shows how a web developer can implement Internet of Things solutions while being interoperable and not locked into vendor specific frameworks.
Additionally, the W3C WoT allows developer experience and skills to be transferred to different application domains such as agriculture,
building or industrial automation, smart homes, and more!

We would like to thank the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative team for their feedback.
