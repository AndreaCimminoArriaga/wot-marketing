# Web of Things - TPAC 2019 Update
Recently the Web of Things (WoT) IG/WG has made significant progress towards our goal of an open
Internet of Things based on web standards.
At the recent W3C TPAC meeting held in Fukuoka Japan on September 16-20,
we once again demonstrated the use of
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-thing-description/">WoT Thing Descriptions</a>
to support interoperability between IoT devices from
multiple manufacturers.
A variety of devices from Panasonic, Fujitsu, Hitachi, Intel were combined with
a Web Things gateway from Mozilla as well as services from Oracle and Siemens to target a variety
of consumer and industrial IoT use cases.
NHK additionally demonstrated an integration of their hybridcast system with WoT,
using data embedded in television broadcasts to drive contextual IoT services,
such as adapting lighting to specific content.

While putting the finishing touches on the 
<a href="">WoT Thing Description</a> and 
<a href="">WoT Architecture</a> documents,
we are also working on renewing our
<a href="https://cdn.statically.io/gh/w3c/wot/master/charters/wot-ig-2019.html?env=dev">IG</a>
and
<a href="https://cdn.statically.io/gh/w3c/wot/master/charters/wot-wg-charter-draft-2019.html?env=dev">WG</a>
charters.
Candidate work items for future work include topics such
as discovery and ad-hoc interoperability in constrained environments.
