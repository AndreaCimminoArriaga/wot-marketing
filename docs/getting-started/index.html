	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>The W3C Web of Things (WoT) seeks to counter the fragmentation of the IoT, making it much easier to create 
		applications without the need to master the disparate variety of IoT technologies and standards. 
		To realize this, WoT specifies some principles and technology building blocks that can be used to 
		complement new or existing IoT ecosystems. An overview of the main WoT principles and building 
		blocks is given here:</p>
	<h3>Thing</h3>
	<p>A Thing is an abstraction of a physical or virtual entity that provides interactions to and participates 
		in the Web of Things. </p>
	<h3>Interaction Affordances: Properties, Actions, Events</h3>
	<p> </p>
	<h3>Thing Description</h3>
	<p>The WoT Thing Description (TD) is a central building block in the W3C Web of Things and can be 
		considered as the entry point of a Thing (much like the index.html of a Web site). Thing descriptions 
                expressed in JSON-LD cover the metadata of the Thing, interaction affordances, data schema, security 
		configuration and protocol bindings. 
        </p>
	<h3>Binding Templates</h3>
	<p> </p>
	<h3>Scripting API</h3>
	<p> </p>
	<h3>Security</h3>
	<p> </p>
