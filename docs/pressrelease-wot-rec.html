    <p id="desc"><a href="/">https://www.w3.org/</a> &#8212; DD Month
    2020 &#8212; The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) announced today
    that <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-architecture/">Web of
    Things (WoT) Architecture</a>
    and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-thing-description/">Web of Things (WoT) Thing
    Description</a> (TD) are now official W3C Recommendations.
    These complement
    existing standardized web technologies to enable easy
    integration across Internet of Things platforms and
    applications. 
    </p>
    <p>Interoperability of devices and services for the Internet of Things (IoT) with cloud platforms and services 
    at a worldwide scale is a huge challenge.<br> 
    
  The mission of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WoT/">Web of Things</a> activities 
  is to counter the fragmentation of the Internet of Things 
  by forming a Web-based abstraction layer capable of interconnecting existing IoT platforms, devices, 
  and cloud services and complementing available standards. It reduces the
    risk of both investors and customers and enables and encourages
    exponential growth of open markets of devices and services.</p>
  <p>
  Two baseline specifications have been developed by the Web of Things Working Group 
  during the last two years. They define an abstract architecture and several building blocks 
  and a common data format for describing devices and services. 
  <ul>
     <li>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-architecture/">WoT Architecture</a> describes the overall Web of Things conceptual framework.</li> 
     <li>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-thing-description/">WoT Thing Description</a> provides a standard way for the metadata 
            of a Thing to be provided, including network API, semantics, and data models.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  The specifications are based upon rich metadata that describes the data and interaction models exposed to applications, 
  and the communications and security requirements for platforms to communicate effectively.
  During the course of the Web of Things standardization activities, several other informative documents were also created.
</p>

    <h3>Objectives</h3>

    <p>
        The goal of the WoT is to enhance interoperability and counter fragmentation in IoT 
        using a cross-ecosystem approach.
        In particular, rather than prescribing behavior, interfaces, or data models, the
        WoT Thing Descriptions provide a common way for descriptive information (metadata) about 
        these key aspects of IoT devices and services to be communicated.
        The ability to share service metadata is a key enabler
        of an open market for IoT devices and services.
    </p>

    <h3>Deliverables</h3>

    <p>

      The two WoT documents that have recently become W3C Recommendations 
      define the WoT Architecture and the WoT Thing Description (TD).
      The WoT Architecture document describes the overall Web of Things conceptual framework.
      The WoT Thing Description provides a standard way for the metadata 
      of a Thing to be provided, including descriptions of its network API, semantics, and data models.
      The WoT Working Group and Interest Group have also published some
      related informative documents: 
      the WoT Security and Privacy Guidelines, 
      the WoT Scripting API, and the WoT Binding Templates.
      The WoT Binding Templates describe how WoT Thing Descriptions can be used 
      with specific concrete protocols.
      The WoT Scripting API provides a common way to access and process 
      WoT Thing Descriptions from within applications.
    </p>

    <h3>Impact</h3>

    <p>
      The Web of Things is applicable to multiple IoT domains, including
      Smart Home, Industrial, Smart City, Retail, and Health applications.
      In general, the use of W3C WoT standards can simplify the development of IoT systems that 
      combine devices from multiple vendors and ecosystems.
      For different kinds of users, the W3C WoT standard can provide specific benefits:
      <ul>
        <li>For developers, WoT
            simplifies software development and service integration.</li>
        <li>For device vendors, WoT 
            provides a mechanism to provide and document open APIs.</li>
        <li>For cloud platform and application vendors, WoT
            provides opportunities to provide support services and applications.</li>
        <li>For system integrators, WoT
            provides a way to build systems that 
            integrate devices across vendors and ecosystems.</li>
        <li>For governments and regulatory agencies building open IoT platforms, WoT
            provides an open standard for communicating available services.</li>
      </ul>
      Many of these use cases and applications were discussed at length
      in a recent <a href="https://www.w3.org/WoT/ws-2019/cfp.html">WoT Workshop</a>. 
    </p>

    <h3>What's Next?</h3>

    <p>
    The WoT WG has recently renewed its charter and will be addressing a number of 
    new issues, including discovery, onboarding, and enhancing interoperability via a 
    profile mechanism.
    See the new <a href="https://www.w3.org/2020/01/wot-wg-charter.html">WoT WG Charter</a>
    for details.
    Additional participants are welcome!

    <h2>About the World Wide Web Consortium</h2>

    <p>The mission of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is to lead
    the Web to its full potential by creating technical standards and
    guidelines to ensure that the Web remains open, accessible, and
    interoperable for everyone around the globe. W3C well-known
    standards HTML and CSS are the foundational technologies upon
    which websites are built. W3C works on ensuring that all
    foundational Web technologies meet the needs of civil society, in
    areas such as accessibility, internationalization, security, and
    privacy. W3C also provides the standards that undergird the
    infrastructure for modern businesses leveraging the Web, in areas
    such as entertainment, communications, digital publishing, and
    financial services. That work is created in the open, provided for
    free and under the groundbreaking W3C Patent Policy. For its work
    to make online videos more accessible with captions and subtitles,
    W3C received a 2016 Emmy Award. And for its work to standardize a
    Full TV Experience on the Web, W3C received a 2019 Emmy
    Award. </p>

    <p>W3C's vision for "One Web" brings together thousands of
    dedicated technologists representing more than
    400 <a href="/Consortium/Member/List">Member organizations</a> and
    dozens of industry sectors. W3C is jointly hosted by

      <p id="siemens">The new WoT standard enables Siemens to better combine and analyze
	data from different systems and domains in a very simple yet
	meaningful way. We use WoT e.g. to integrate devices and subsystems into
   	our flagship building management station Desigo CC and from there to the cloud.
	Heterogenous and proprietary <abbr title="Operational Technology">OT</abbr> and IoT solutions caused in the past
	significant engineering and maintenance effort, e.g. if you wanted to
	analyze holistically data from different sources in a building.
	Using WoT we can quickly integrate data from different devices into a
	data pool and use that pool for further value creation,
	e.g. analytics, engineering, validation, energy optimization.</p>

      <p id="">We are pleased to see that "Web of Things" which connects a diverse range of IoT systems
        through Web technology has now been released as a W3C recommendation.
        Progress in IoT is driving an accelerated rate of data generated by business and society.
        Delivering appropriate feedback to the field using this data will lead to the creation of new value.
        We hope that “Web of Things” will make it easier to access insights and on-site equipment
        from across a wide range of operations and industry sectors, and enable the agile creation of
        new value for future society.</p>
