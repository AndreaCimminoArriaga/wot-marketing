				Typically, in classical IoT projects developer have to challenge the situation to understand a heterogeneous technologies landscape of the IoT systems and services from different vendors and manufacturers. This includes the variations of the used communication protocols, data models for the payload data exchange, and security requirements. IoT applications are usually highly effortfully developed and narrowed for a specific use case. During their lifetime, such applications are difficult to extend, maintain or reuse.

				The Web of Things (WoT) provides a set of standardized technology building blocks that helps to simplify the IoT application development by following the well-known and successful Web paradigm. Thereby flexibility and interoperability is getting increased, especially for cross-domain applications, as well as the reusage of established standards and tools. Thus WoT unlocks the commercial potential that was held back by IoT fragmentation so far (please read <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-architecture/">here</a> to get more background about WoT use cases and basic paradigms).

				By the introduction of a simple interaction abstraction layer by WoT’s properties-action-event any IoT interface can be described. Thus, applications have a common anchor to retrieve IoT’s metadata as well as what and how the data &amp; functions can be accessed (please read <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-architecture/#sec-interaction-model">here</a> to get more background about the properties-action-event paradigm).

				This kind of information is documented what is called <strong>WoT Thing Description (TD)</strong>. The TD is a central building block in the W3C Web of Things and can be considered as the entry point of an IoT instance (much like the index.html of a Web site). It gives answer such as which data and/or functions are served, which protocol, serialization, and security mode is used, and further metadata. A TD is expressed in JSON-LD and can be hosted, e.g., by an IoT device itself or hosted externally like a TD directory (please read <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-thing-description/">here</a> to get more background about the WoT Thing Description).

				In general, WoT is a protocol agnostic approach and provides a common mechanism how specific protocols such as MQTT, HTTP, CoAP or Modbus can be mapped to the mentioned WoT’s interaction properties-action-event paradigm.
			</p>
			<p>
				This mapping and protocol specific metadata are provided by the <strong>WoT Binding Templates</strong>. It provides a guideline how a client can activate the interaction through a corresponding network-facing interface (please read <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-binding-templates/">here</a> to get more background about the WoT Binding Templates).

				The (optional) <strong>WoT Scripting API</strong> building block defines an ECMAScript API that closely follows the WoT Thing Description specification. It defines the interface between behavior implementations and a scripting-based WoT Runtime. Please note that WoT is not limited to a scripting environment. Programming languages such as Java or C/C++ can be derived from the Scripting API (please read <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-scripting-api/">here</a> to get more background about the WoT Scripting API). Web of Things provides also guidance on <strong>WoT Security and Privacy</strong>. It is cross-cutting building block which provides guidelines for the secure implementation and configuration of Things, and discusses issues which should be considered in any systems implementing W3C WoT (please read <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-security/">here</a> to get more background about the WoT Scripting API).
