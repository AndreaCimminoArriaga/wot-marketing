# Talking Points
For Press Release - See https://www.w3.org/2019/12/pressrelease-css-writing-modes-rec.html.en
for an example

## Topics
- Two REC documents: Architecture and Thing Description
- New WG Charter

## Objectives
- Enhance interoperability and counter fragmentation in IoT using a cross-ecosystem approach
- Provide a common way for descriptive information about IoT devices and services to be communicated
- Enabling an open market for IoT devices and services

## Impact
- Applicable to multiple domains: Smart Home, Industrial, Smart City, Retail, Health, and others.
- Simplify the development of IoT systems that combine devices from multiple vendors and ecosystems.
- For developers, simplifies software development and service integration.
- For device vendors, provides a mechanism to provide and document open APIs.
- For cloud platform and application vendors, provides opportunities to provide support services and applications.
- For system integrators, provides a way to build systems that integrate devices across vendors and ecosystems.
- For governments and regulatory agencies building open IoT platforms,
  provides an open standard for communicating available services.

## Documents
- Architecture describes the overall Web of Things conceptual framework.
- The Thing Description provides a standard way for the
  metadata of a Thing to be provided,
  including network API, semantics, and data models.
- There are other related informative documents: Security and Privacy Guidelines, Scripting API, and Binding Templates
- Binding Templates describe how the Thing Description can be used with specific concrete protocols
- Scripting API provides a common way to access and process Thing Descriptions from applications

## New WG Charter
