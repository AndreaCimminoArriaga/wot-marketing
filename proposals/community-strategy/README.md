# Community engagement strategy

The community is the key for a standard. Without adoption, the defined standard is pointless.
Other standards, such as [Project Connected Home over IP](https://www.connectedhomeip.com/), 
are moving forward with a lot of support from the industry. 

This directory contains ideas how to push the standard and grow the community behind it.

## 1. Documentation and libraries

Before reaching out to a wide range of developers the base must be present.
Reference implementations in the major languages, such as C, Javascript and Java, must be present and well maintained.
An extensive documentation for them must be present as well.

## 2. Reaching out to Open source projects

Integration into other projects is very important. 
Therefore it makes sense to get in touch with relevant Open source communities.
In order to help them with their implementations, people must be present on relevant [social media channels](social-media.md).
Meetups and Conferences are helpful to get in touch with these communities.

## 4. Broader community push

Once there is an adoption in the open source community, it makes sense to push WoT in a broader way.
This would also include developers which don't contribute to open source projects.

### Conclusion

Since the W3C is a bit slow with its processes, it makes sense to do this outside of the W3C.
With a seperate community driven website and a small team supported by the major contributor of WoT. 
[Thingweb](http://www.thingweb.io/) is a good approach, even though the design looks outdated.
The [node-wot](https://github.com/eclipse/thingweb.node-wot) is missing some important features, such as cbor.
The [wotify library](https://wotify.org/library) has also an interesting approach in collecting implementations of WoT. 
Even though the library looks unfinished and only contains PoCs.
