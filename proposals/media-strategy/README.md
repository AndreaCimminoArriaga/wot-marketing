# Media strategy

In order to reach a wider audience the W3C WoT standards need a higher media coverage. This also helps to provide reliable source for the Wikipedia as mentioned in [#94](https://github.com/w3c/wot-marketing/issues/94)

As stated in the [Github 2020 Octoverse report](https://octoverse.github.com/) and the [Stackoverflow Developer survey 2020](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020), Javascript is still the most used programming language. The most loved languages in this ecosystem are [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/). 
These frameworks have in common to have an appealing website. But this is not only common in the Javascript ecosystem. 
It is a trend to have well designed websites, across frameworks. Even recent security bugs get [well designed Logos and a website.](https://spectreattack.com/)

# Website

The user attention is valuable and should be treated as such. In a network where an information is just one click away, users want to get the information they need as fast as possible. 
A website should take this into account. Just the VueJS and React.js website as an example.
Within the users viewport all necessary information are displayed.
The user gets the following questions answered within seconds: "What do I look at?", "What is this framework/library about?" "Why should I use it?"
This is necessary to keep the users attention and get them excited. Before going into the technical details, the user has to understand why this site is relevant for them. In case of the W3C WoT standard, this means: Don't focus on the standard itself, focus on what the user can do with the standard. 
The next step is to get the user familiar with the standard. Still with the focus on what the user is able to do with it.
The getting-started guide has to be simple enough for all kind of level. Even the programming beginner needs to be able to follow the guide.
This is very important, since a junior developer might work for a big company in a year and acts as an internal influencer. 
Especially young people drive new technological topics forward. 
The people following the guide have to get an understanding what they are able to do with the standard. This is the point where the user brings in the own imagination. The imagination of solving familiar issues with this standard. This helps to attach people emotionally to the topic. Eventually a website uses peoples emotions in order to drive them into an action. The action in the WoT should be to get as many people familiar with the standard as possible. 
Of course, the website should also contain other information. Such as documentation, events, toolings etc. But these are secondary goals and form around the main goal of getting people into the ecosystem.

# Media

Eventually articles about technology are written by people. When we get them attached to the topic they will act as influencer.
They will use their reach in order to inform other people about great tech. 
Even though this is the case, a critical mass has to get reached in order to have a good organic growth. 
In order to reach this mass, we probably have to reach out to the media and even have to write articles about the standard ourselves.
The structure for a [community](../community-strategy/README.md) should be present. The website also should contain the previously mentioned points. Otherwise the time invested into the media outreach might be wasted.
