# Notes for Explainer Video Script

[Original slides](https://github.com/w3c/wot-marketing/blob/master/material/wot_explainer_script.pdf)

## Scene 1
* Text: 
   - A winegrower is looking for possibilities to increase (his) productivity while keeping the excellent quality of (his) products
       - Alt: A winemaker is looking for ways to increase productivity while keeping excellent product quality
* Staging: Far-away view of vineyard (maybe animation that zooms in from clouds...)
* Comments: 
   - Should gender-specific "his" be changed to gender-neutral "their" or perhaps to "her"?
     We could also use "the winegrower" etc.  BTW is "winegrower" standard usage in English?  Or is "winemaker" better?
     There are also multiple people (winegrower, consultant) - these could be different genders.
     This issue applies to the entire text.
     To highlight this issue I have put all gender-specific pronouns in parenthesis, and suggested some alternative text that avoids the issue.
   - The original draft script had a female winegrower.  What happened?
   - There is also the issue of race.
   - We could maybe avoid the whole issue by using animal characters (eg cat and rabbits...)


## Scene 2
* Text:
   - To constantly control the quality of (his) plants (he) is willing to install humidity and temperature sensors, and a sprinkler system.
       - Alt: To constantly control quality, the winemaker is willing to install humidity and temperature sensors and a sprinkler system.
   - In addition (he) wants to to receive weather forecasts from an online web service
       - Alt: Weather forecasts from an online web service would also be useful
* Staging: 
   - Keep zooming in, stop on a closeup of some grapes on the vine
   - Show addition of sensors and sprinkler system
   - Show data coming from cloud (since it's weather data, can be from an actual cloud...)
   
## Scene 3
* Text: 
   - Lost in programming and connecting the devices (he) decides to engage (his) preferred IT consultant - who programmed (his) web presence - for realizing (his) IoT solution
       - Alt: Lost in programming and connecting devices, the winemaker decides to engage the IT consultant - who programmed the winemaker's web presence - to realize an IoT solution
* Staging: 
    - Show a "development system" that explodes in complexity
    - Winemaker has an idea (maybe a thought bubble) of asking the consultant that was used for the web presence for help with IoT
* Comments: 
   - Image in original shows a messy breadboard, but a more "professional" picture that relates to software (perhaps a circle-and-line graph that explodes in complexity) would be better.
   
## Scene 4
* Text:
   - Web Agency
   - Rosental 7, Munich, Germany
   - phone: +49 89 12345678
   - twitter: @webagency
   - The Web Agency is your solution provider when it comes to realizing your (personal or business) web and social media presence
* Staging: Show the result of an online search for a web solution provider
* Comments: 
   - Suggest deleting "personal and business", "personal" is weird, and phrase does not add value; put in paras above

## Scene 5
* Text:
    - (Joe), the lead developer at Web Agency likes the new challenge and is willing to broaden (his) IoT knowledge
    - (He) is an expert in Web technologies and does programming of both frontend as well as backend with Node JS
    - However, (he) only has a vague idea how to integrate hardware and fears the interoperability dilemma that he experienced in a former IoT project
* Staging:
    - Show picture of a developer hacking away, scratching his head, shuddering a little at some bad memories of a past project (maybe a thought bubble showing him vainly trying to plug together two incompatible connectors)
* Comment
    - "Joe" is another male... consider mixing it up a little, at least.
    - Also, we should avoid making all the characters white...
    
## Scene 6
* Text: 
    - Googling for a while for a better solution (he -> the consultant) finds information about the Web of Things (WoT)
    - WoT is a W3C activity that (promises -> enables) Web developers to become IoT developers using the tools and frameworks they love
    - WoT can be applied to different domains, (like -> such) as Industry or Building Automation
* Staging:
    - Google search, some results pop up (represented as icons and logos)
* Comments:
    - "Promises" is weird English.  "Allows" or "Enables" would be more natural
    - "like" is also more natural as "such"; changed above
