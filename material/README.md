# Script Changes (Responses to Animator)

* Scene 1: The Winemaker -> Vegetable Grower, OK to make this change.
* Scene 4: Simplifying and not showing any specific address or phone number in particular is fine.
* Scene 6: OK to not spell out the acronym.   However, the person doing the voice-over should pronounce it this way.  As for the logos, we would like these or something similar.  We can send you the powerpoint slide as I think these were just clip-art, but I’m not sure of the rights for these.  Worst case, simply draw something (or use clipart you have the rights to) that represents each of the domains (cloud, smart home, industry, etc).   We don’t need these specific logos.
* Scene 7: We are putting the files together.  The code and sensors will be for temperature and humidity.   So an appropriate “UI” would be to show a couple of graphs and logos (eg a thermometers and a water drop) representing these two values.  Cc: Daniel who will be working on the TD and the node-wot files, he will send them directly.
* Scene 10: Please just do whichever works for the timing and the voice-over.   Reading out the words is fine.  Note again the image is NOT the text we want read out.
* Scene 13: The WoT logo is here: https://www.w3.org/WoT/IG/wiki/File:WOT-hz.svg.  Please use the “simpler” one, and make sure to preserve the color (blue).
