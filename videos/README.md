Some raw video material,
including short segments of "plugfest" demos that we can edit together into a "demo" video for a breakout session,
or a "WoT introduction" video.

These do not need to be final.  Please create an MD file with the same basename as the video explaining it.
Videos should be suitable for public distribution e.g. all rights and releases should have been obtained.
Please do not, for instance, use music you have not obtained the rights to.
